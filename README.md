These are two applications that roll dice.

One is a WIP that utilizes a GUI:
There will eventually be more boxes for rolling different types/amounts of dice.
Due to my lack of knowledge in Tkinter, I had to use some work arounds that are not ideal but still display what is intended.

The second is a text-based application:
The code isn't neat and there is a lot of redundancy and inefficiency.
I could clean it up but I would rather focus my attention on the GUI project.
