These are two applications that roll dice.

One is a non-functioning WIP that utilizes a GUI:
There will eventually be more boxes for rolling different types/amounts of dice. This should be easy, I just want to finish the clear roll history feature first before moving on.
I am currently stuck on tring to clear the roll history list at the bottom of the screen.

The second is a text-based application:
The code isn't neat and there is a lot of redundancy and inefficiency.
I could clean it up but I would rather focus my attention on the GUI project.
